# Driver Distraction and Drowsiness Detection 🚗😴

This project is a real-time **Driver Monitoring System** that detects **driver distraction and drowsiness** using **YOLO and Deep Learning**.  
It aims to improve road safety by identifying unsafe driver behavior and triggering alerts.

## 🔍 Features
- Real-time driver monitoring using camera feed  
- YOLO-based object detection  
- Eye closure and blink analysis for drowsiness  
- Alert system for unsafe driving behavior  

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python  
- YOLO (Ultralytics)  
- OpenCV  
- TensorFlow / PyTorch  
- Flask  

## 📊 Results
- Accurate real-time detection  
- Low latency response  
- Suitable for real-world deployment
